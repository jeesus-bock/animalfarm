# Contributing
I'm having a little trouble with the word contributing here. Having a good time, chilling together would probably be closer to what I'm after :). 
We're obviously not building a profitable product, not even a usable product either so there's no that angle here at all.

At the moment I'm doing this alone, but whenver some other lost soul appears we should set up some type of a chat so we can communicate more efficiently.
IRC or Discord or whatever.

## Get in the project
Leave a comment to https://github.com/jeesus-bock/animalfarm/issues/3 and I'll add you. Or just message me! After that create your own dev branch and start coding.

## Stuff to maybe do
- More API end-points to data-server. I'd venture there ought to be endpoints for player and species and animals at least.
- Separate microservices. This provides the possibiity to use whatever language you want.
- Database connectivity is always intriguing to get working. Data-server uses sqlite at the moment, but it could be using mysql or postgres or some nosql solution.
- More species. This is fun stuff, looking for utf glyphs that would make good chars for the creatures on the animalfarm. I'm thinking we could use different languages like arabic or chinese to group the monsters into gangs or something.
- Ui development. The UI is a stub at the moment. It should probably be actually designed. Good opportunity to learn figma etc.
  - Microfrontends! I've only heard this buzzword around but never really studied it.
  - WebComponents. These could be nifty to use with VanJS and would support the microservice thing. Opens up chances for https://github.com/lit/lit and Svelte and whatnot.
- CI/CD This provides tons of possibilities. I have a few VPSes but also interested in free hosting services like netlify and vercel etc. Even converting the backend(s) to run serverless!
