# Contributing
I'm having a little trouble with the word contributing here. Having a good time, chilling together would probably be closer to what I'm after :). 
We're obviously not building a profitable product, not even a usable product either so there's no that angle here at all.

At the moment I'm doing this alone, but whenver some other lost soul appears we should set up some type of a chat so we can communicate more efficiently.
IRC or Discord or whatever.

## Get in the project
Leave a comment to https://github.com/jeesus-bock/animalfarm/issues/3 and I'll add you. Or just message me! After that create your own dev branch and start coding.
